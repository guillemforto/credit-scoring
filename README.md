# Credit scoring

When a bank loans, it becomes important to asses their clients' repayment abilities. This is the repository for a classical supervised classification problem written in R where we address this problem: predicting a binary variable Y, which takes 0 if the credit is issued, and 1 otherwise.

This project was part of the Mathematics of Deep Learning course of the M2 Statistics and Econometrics, at Toulouse School of Economics.


## Running the code
To run the code, simply open `main.R` with RStudio (>= version 1.2.5001 required) to execute the script. You may need to install several packages, but RStudio will propose to install them automatically if it detects you still don't have them.

## Additional information
- `theory.pdf` gives the mathematical and statistical details of the methods that we used to deal with the Credit dataset.

- `RMarkdown_knit.pdf` contains the script and the outputs in a single file.
